1. Create array named rollDistribution of size 11
2. Create a Scanner object named input
3. Print "Welcome to Rolling Dice! Simulate rolling a pair of dice."
4. Prompt the user with "How many rolls? " and read input to numRollsInput
5. While numRollsInput is not a positive integer:
    a. Prompt the user with "Invalid, try again: " and read input to numRollsInput
6. Convert numRollsInput to an integer and assign it to numRolls
7. Loop numRolls times:
    a. Generate two random integers between 1 and 6 inclusive and assign them to rollOne and rollTwo
    b. Increment the element at index (rollOne + rollTwo - 2) in rollDistribution
8. Initialize a string named result as "Distribution:\n"
9. For index in rollDistribution:
    a. Append the current index plus 2 and "*"'s equal to the value of the current element to result
10. Print result
